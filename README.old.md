## Get2gether

Get2gether allows you to create an equidistant meeting place between you and your friends.

### How’s it work?

An organizer messages up to 10 friends a link to a map that allows that person to drop a pin at their home or work location.

We then find a coffee shop or bar that’s most accessible for all persons to meet.
